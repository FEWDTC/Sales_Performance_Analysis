## **Key Findings**
### **Total Revenue per Product**
- The highest revenue-generating product is **Tablet ($43,705.54)**, followed by **Laptops ($27,586.65)**.
- **Business Recommendation:** Increase inventory & optimize marketing spend on high-performing products.

### **Monthly Sales Trend**
- Peak sales occurred in **March**, indicating a strong demand during this period.
- **Business Recommendation:** Investigate factors driving the March peak (e.g., seasonal demand, promotions, or market trends) and apply similar strategies in future months.

### **Customer Retention Insights**
- **New customer acquisition peaked in March (27 new customers) but dropped sharply in April (9 new customers).**
- **Business Recommendation:** Investigate the reason for the April decline (e.g., lower marketing spend, seasonal demand drop).

### **Customer Segmentation Insights**
- **Low Value Customers (65.6%)** are the majority but contribute the least revenue.
- **High Value Customers (1.6%)** are a small group but likely generate the most revenue per customer.
- **Business Recommendation:** Focus on **retaining High-Value Customers** through personalized offers and loyalty programs.
